# Chore Planning

Create a new plan in `specs/*.md` to resolve the `Chore` using the exact specified markdown `Plan Format`. Follow the `Instructions` and use the `Relevant Files` to focus on the right files.

## Instructions

- Research the codebase and put together a plan to accomplish the chore.
- IMPORTANT: Replace every `<placeholder>` in the `Plan Format` with the requested value.
- Use your reasoning model: THINK HARD about the plan and the steps.
- Start your research by reading `CLAUDE.md`.
