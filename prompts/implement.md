# Implement the Following Plan

Follow the `Instructions` to implement the `Plan`, then `Report` the completed work.

## Instructions

- Read the plan carefully. Think hard about the plan, then implement it step by step.
- Research the codebase for relevant files and existing patterns before writing code.
- Include useful logging for potential error debugging
- For every logic change or new feature, you must create or update a corresponding test file within the tests folder.
- You must check the runtime logs or console output to ensure there are no silent failures or regressions.
- Run all validation commands listed in the plan after implementation.
- If validation fails, analyze the error and fix it. Repeat until all checks pass.
- Commit changes with a descriptive message.
